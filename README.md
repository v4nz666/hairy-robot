Installation -

Very complicated at the moment, documentation will follow later

Installation For the Very Old Proof-of-Concept - 

For now, you must have a webserver running as jr.glo.lan

Install node.js from http://nodejs.org/

From the command line run (in the root of the cloned repository):

`npm install jquery`

and

`npm install socket.io`

then run:

`node server.js`
